Using data from zulip, Hacker School's chatroom, we have been doing analyses using hadoop, dumbo, and SQL. 

Some sample questions to be answered:
------------------------------------
What does the distribution of zulip use look like? Does this reflect the social dynamic of the group?
Who gets tagged the most often in posts?
What are the daily/weekly patterns in zulip use?
Who uses the most emojis?
Which programming languages are talkeda bout the most?
